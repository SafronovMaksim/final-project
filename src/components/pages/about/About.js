          <p>All our culinary recipes and gastronomic finds and ideas are accompanied by step-by-step photos and instructions. We show only what we have experienced, tried and tested, found this or that idea useful, so we are happy to share it with you. poVAR.by â€“ this is a real "library" of small and big tricks that have been tested on ourselves, on our friends and relatives. We pay tribute to the uniqueness of our work, and therefore all the recipes of our portal are author's, but they are not the ultimate truth and always imply culinary maneuvers for your kitchen. For example, if the recipe specifies leek as an ingredient, and you do not have it in your home bins, you can safely go for a substitution and use the onion that is familiar to you.</p>
